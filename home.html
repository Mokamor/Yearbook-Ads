        <h3>Why Do We Need Ads?</h3>
          <p>Having ads in our yearbook helps to support our school community. By having
          ads in the yearbook we help students to become more engaged with local businesses
          and become more aware of the various opportunities available to them. Selling ads
          also helps to decrease the cost of purchasing a yearbook for students, teachers, and
          families!</p>
        
        <h3>Why Should You Purchase an Ad?</h3>
          <p>Purchasing ads for the ASD yearbook helps our community, but it also helps you! Having an ad in our yearbook will allow more students to engage with your business, and share their knowledge with friends and family. Students are always looking for more places to explore, and your ad will help them do that. Our students and faculty also come from many cities and towns in New Hampshire, so no business is too far!</p>
